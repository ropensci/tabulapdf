# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.19 #

* Further expand the `locate_areas()` interface to use a Shiny gadget when working within RStudio, or otherwise rely on the full functionality interface (based on graphics device events) or reduced functionality interface (relying on `locator()`). (#8)

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.18 #

* Completely rewrite the `locate_areas()` interface to rely on graphics device event handling where possible. This may behave differently across platforms or in RStudio. (#8)

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.17 #

* Fixed a bug in `extract_tables()` such that when no tables are found, an empty list is returned (for `method` values with list response structures). (h/t Lincoln Mullen)

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.16 #

* `split_pdfs()` and `make_thumbnails()` gain an `outdir` argument to specify where to save the output. The file numbering of output files is also now zero-padded.
* An warning in `merge_pdfs()` has been fixed.
* `stop_logging()` is called when the package is attached to the search path.
* `get_page_dims()` earns a `doc` argument and argument order in `get_n_pages()` is reversed.

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.15 #

* Added better support for specifying character encoding. (#10)

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.14 #

* Added support for password-protected PDF files. (#11)

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.13 #

* Expand file paths where needed. (h/t David Gohel)

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.12 #

* Improve handling of URLs when using `extract_areas()` by downloading PDF to temporary directory.

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.11 #

* Exposed new functions `split_pdf()` and `merge_pdfs()` to split and merge PDFs, respectively. (#9)
* Exposed a `get_n_pages()` to determine the page length of a PDF document.
* Moved tabula .jar file to separate package, tabulizerjars. (#2)

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.10 #

* Added a new function `extract_metadata()` to extract PDF metadata as a list.
* Added a new function `extract_text()` to convert PDF contents to an R character vector.
* Changed the internal `localize_file()` function to use PDFBox to natively read from a URL.
* Removed illogical default `file` argument value in `extract_tables()`.

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.9 #

* Expanded test suite to cover `areas` and `columns` arguments and utilities. (#3)
* Fixed the same bug in `make_columns()` as was corrected for `make_areas()`. (#5)

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.8 #

* Fixed a bug in `make_areas()` internal when `area` was specified as a length 1 list for a multi-page document. (#5, h/t Tony Hirst)

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.7 #

* Added a function, `extract_areas()`, to interactively identify and extract page areas. Another new function, `locates_areas()` implements the locator functionality without performing any extraction.
* Added a function, `make_thumbnails()`, to convert pages into individual image files.
* Added a function, `get_page_dims()`, to extract page dimensions.

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.6 #

* Fixed a bug in the repeating of the `area` argument when `length(area) == 1 & length(pages) > 1`. (#5, #6)

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.5 #

* Fixed a bug in the handling of the `area` argument. (#5, #6)

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.4 #

* Added vignette. (#4)

* Added a `spreadsheet` argument, a la Tabula itself.
* Fixed bugs in parsing of `area` and `columns` arguments.

* Added multiple table writing options beyond the default list of matrices. (#1)

# CHANGES TO tabulizer 0.1.1 #
