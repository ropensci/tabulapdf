**tabulapdf** provides R bindings to the [Tabula java library](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java/), which can be used to computationaly extract tables from PDF documents.

Note: tabulapdf is released under the MIT license, as is Tabula itself.

## Installation

tabulapdf depends on [rJava](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rJava), which
implies a system requirement for Java. This can be frustrating, especially on
Windows. The preferred Windows workflow is to use
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to obtain, configure, and update Java.
You need do this before installing rJava or attempting to use tabulapdf. More on
[this](#installing-java-on-windows-with-chocolatey) and
[troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

tabulapdf is available on CRAN, and it can also be installed from rOpenSci's
R-Universe:
```r
# either
install.packages("tabulapdf")

# or
install.packages("tabulapdf", repos = c("https://ropensci.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

To install the latest development version:
```r
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")

# on 64-bit Windows
remotes::install_github(c("ropensci/tabulapdf"), INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch")

# elsewhere
remotes::install_github(c("ropensci/tabulapdf"))
```

## Code Examples

The main function, `extract_tables()` provides an R clone of the Tabula command line application:

```r
library(tabulapdf)
f <- system.file("examples", "data.pdf", package = "tabulapdf")
out <- extract_tables(f)
out[[1]]

The vignette provides more examples and details on how to use the package.

## Installing Java on Windows with Chocolatey

In Power Shell prompt, install Chocolately if you don't already have it.

Run `Get-ExecutionPolicy`. If it returns `Restricted`, then run `Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned` or `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`. Then, install Chocolatey by running the following command:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

Install java using the following command:

```
choco install openjdk11
```

You should now be able to safely open R, and use rJava and tabulapdf. From
PowerShell, you should see something like this after running `java -version`:

```
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.22+7-post-Ubuntu-0ubuntu222.04.1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.22+7-post-Ubuntu-0ubuntu222.04.1, mixed mode, sharing)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Mac OS and Linux

We tested with OpenJDK version 11. The package is configured to ask for that
version of Java. If you have a different version of Java installed, you may need
to change the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the correct version.

You need to ensure that R has been installed with Java support. This can often
be fixed by running `R CMD javareconf` on the command line (possibly with
`sudo`).

### Windows

Make sure you have permission to write to and install packages to your R
directory before trying to install the package. This can be changed from
"Properties" on the right-click context menu. Alternatively, you can ensure
write permission by choosing "Run as administrator" when launching R (again,
from the right-click context menu).

## Debugging

Load the package like this:

```r
devtools::load_all()
libname = "/home/pacha/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.4"
pkgname = "tabulapdf"
rJava::.jpackage(pkgname, jars = "*", lib.loc = libname)
rJava::J("java.lang.System")$setProperty("java.awt.headless", "true")
```
