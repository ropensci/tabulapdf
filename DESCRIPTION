Title: Extract Tables from PDF Documents
Description: Bindings for the 'Tabula' <https://tabula.technology/> 'Java'
    library, which can extract tables from PDF files. This tool can reduce time
    and effort in data extraction processes in fields like investigative
    journalism. It allows for automatic and manual table extraction, the latter
    facilitated through a 'Shiny' interface, enabling manual areas selection\
    with a computer mouse for data retrieval.
